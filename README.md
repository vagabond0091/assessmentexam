# Getting Started

### Reference Documentation
For further reference, please consider the following sections:

### Setting up the project

To run the project. import the project on your ide and make sure you change the application properties for database configuration.
currently I was using MYSQL 8 and java 17 for this assessment exam.

### Notes:
Make sure to create your database and add the database name in the application properties.


### Usage
 Access the http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/project-controller in the swagger
go to the /createProject api end point to create project and task.


For the pay load I added a createProject json file for you to paste it on the end point. 
feel free to modify the createProject.json

Make sure you take note of the task id for this initial creation of the task. It's better to add it on the notepad
because that task id will be needed for the next creation of task with dependencies.

I will add a createProjectAndTaskWithDependency json file in this project.
modify the task id on the depency on that json file to avoid getting an error.
The usage of that file is same as the createProject json.
